It is a practice project about the how to perform Binary Classifation on the Breast Tumor Dataset

I have used R language to implement 
several machine learning algorithms like:
    - Decision Trees
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Neural Network
    
I was able to achieve maximum AUC-ROC Scores on Cross Validation and Testing Data
