It is a practice project about the how to perform Binary Classifation on the Breast Tumor Dataset

I have used R language to implement   
several machine learning algorithms like:  
    - Decision Trees  
    - Support Vector Machines  
    - Neural Network  
      
I was able to achieve maximum AUC-ROC Scores on Cross Validation and Testing Data  
  
Algorithms:-            
  
Decision Trees        
Cross Validation Data  0.953       Testing Data    0.961 
  
Support Vector Machines    
Cross Validation Data  0.976       Testing Data    0.942    
  
Neural Network         
Cross Validation Data  0.967       Testing Data    0.942
